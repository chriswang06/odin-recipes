    <h4>Description:</h3>
    <p>
        Here's a recipe for Neapolitan style pizza you can make at home, inspired by the best pizza in Naples Italy! 
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients you will need:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza Dough</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Mozzarella Cheese</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Basil Leaves</li>
        <li>Flour/Cornmeal</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the dough </li>
        <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F.</li>
        <li>Make the pizza sauce</li>
        <li>Slice the mozzarella into ¼ inch thick pieces. If it’s incredibly watery fresh mozzarella (all brands vary), you may want to let it sit on a paper towel to remove moisture for about 15 minutes then dab the mozzarella with the paper towel to remove any additional moisture.</li>
        <li>When the oven is ready, stretch the dough into a circle. Sprinkle a pizza peel with flour or cornmeal, then carefully place the dough on top. Spread the pizza sauce across the dough. Top with mozzarella cheese.  Taste a bite of the mozzarella cheese; if it does not taste salty, add a few pinches of salt to the pizza.</li>
        <li>Add basil leaves</li>
        <li>Transfer the pizza to the pizza stone, and bake until the cheese is melted, or around 7 minutes. Slice and serve.   </li>
    </ol>
