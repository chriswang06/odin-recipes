    <h3 class ="bold">Ingredients: </h3>
    <h5 class ="bold">Meatballs: </h5>
    <ul>
        <li>White bread</li>
        <li>lean ground beef</li>
        <li>Italian Sausage meat</li>
        <li>parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 class ="bold">Marinara Sauce: </h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Yellow Onion</li>
        <li>Crushed Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Bay Leaves (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class ="bold">Instructions: </h3>
    <h5 class ="bold">Meatballs: </h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine diced crustless bread pieces with 2/3 cup water and set aside for 5 minutes then mash together with a fork.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, add: 1 lb ground beef, 1 lb sausage, 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 4 minced garlic cloves, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1 egg and the mashed moist bread crumbs. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Form into 1 1/2″ meatballs (about a flat ice cream scoop’s worth of meat). Dredge/roll meatballs in flour. Heat a deep, large, heavy skillet or a Dutch oven over medium heat with about 3 Tbsp oil. Add meatballs in batches so you don’t crowd the pan and saute until browned on all sides (6 min total or 2 min per side). Remove meatballs to a separate dish and set aside (don’t worry about cooking through at this point).</li>
    </ol>
    <h5 class ="bold">Marinara Sauce</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>In the same skillet over medium heat, add more oil if needed and saute 1 cup chopped onion stirring often until soft and golden (5 min). Add 4 cloves minced garlic and stir 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in 2 cans of crushed tomatoes and 2 bay leaves. Bring to a light boil (stir to make sure it’s actually boiling and hot and not just letting bubbles to the surface).</li>
        <li>Add meatballs back into the pan with tomato sauce, partially cover and cook at a gentle simmer for 30 min, turning the meatballs occasionally. Meatballs will be tender and sauce will be thickened. 5 minutes before your sauce is done, stir in chopped fresh basil and add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
